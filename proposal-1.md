# Dataset
[Men's Professional Basketball Data](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv)

## Proposal

This dataset has information on over 3000 players and season statistics on each player from 1950 to 2017.
With this dataset, I can compare top players by statistics, and show which teams had statistically better players. I can use hypothesis testing to show that a specific team *used* to be better (back in my day) compared to how they played in more recent years. I could also prove statistically how much better of a point guard Stephon Marbury was on the Knicks than Jeremy Lin.
