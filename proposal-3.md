# Dataset
[Video Game Data]

## Proposal
This dataset describes Video Game sales across mulitple different countries, publishers, and decades. With information on sales data by country, I can compare the popularity of Sega in Japan versus the US (as well as Nintendo). Using hypothesis testing, I could prove (or fail to prove) that Mario is more popular than Sonic. I could also prove (or fail to prove) that ET was the worst game of all time.
