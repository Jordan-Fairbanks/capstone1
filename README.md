### Introduction

The purpose of this study is to show the impact that the 3 Pointer had on the NBA. In it, I aim to prove that the addition of the 3 Pointer has led to games that are less exciting to watch. With players only caring about 3 pointers, they dunk less, drive less, steal less, block less, and shoot faster. This may or may not have led to more points per game, but it clearly diminished the artistry of movement we, as fans, used to enjoy in the 1970's and 80's. 

### Sources
For this study, I used the free dataset [NBA Players stats since 1950](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv) to look at the trends in player statistics over the years. I also used nba.net's [list of rule changes](https://cdn.nba.net/nba-drupal-prod/nba-rules-changes-history.pdf) throughout the history of the NBA.

### Technology

The EDA and visualizations were all done with python, pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
