This directory was created solely to show Data scientist extraordinaire and Galvanize's 2021 East Coast Remote Program Lead of the Year - Skylar English, who is humble enough to describe his teaching as "...boorish, pedantic, and altogether unprofessional...",  my proposals for my first capstone projects. 
 
# Dataset 1
[Men's Professional Basketball Data](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv)

## Proposal 1

This dataset has information on over 3000 players and season statistics on each player from 1950 to 2017.
With this dataset, I can compare top players by statistics, and show which teams had statistically better players. I can use hypothesis testing to show that a specific team *used* to be better (back in my day) compared to how they played in more recent years. I could also prove statistically how much better of a point guard Stephon Marbury was on the Knicks than Jeremy Lin.

# Dataset 2
[Movies Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

## Proposal 2

This is The Movie Database (tmdb), which describes over 5000 movies using a variety of information, like the title, genre, director, average rating, budget, revenue. Using the information in this dataset, I could use hypothesis testing to show that Martin Scorcese is statistically more popular and higher rated than Quentin Tarantino, or possibly that action comedies are more popular than horror.

# Dataset 3
[Video Game Data](https://www.kaggle.com/juttugarakesh/video-game-data)

## Proposal 3
This dataset describes Video Game sales across mulitple different countries, publishers, and decades. With information on sales data by country, I can compare the popularity of Sega in Japan versus the US (as well as Nintendo). Using hypothesis testing, I could prove (or fail to prove) that Mario is more popular than Sonic. I could also prove (or fail to prove) that ET was the worst game of all time.
