# Dataset
[Movies Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

## Proposal

This is The Movie Database (tmdb), which describes over 5000 movies using a variety of information, like the title, genre, director, average rating, budget, revenue. Using the information in this dataset, I could use hypothesis testing to show that Martin Scorcese is statistically more popular and higher rated than Quentin Tarantino, or possibly that action comedies are more popular than horror.
